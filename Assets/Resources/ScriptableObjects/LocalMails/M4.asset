    !!\n\nDear Sir:\n\n\nI have been requested by the Nigerian National Petroleum
    Company to contact you for assistance in resolving a matter. The Nigerian National
    Petroleum Company has recently concluded a large number of contracts for oil
    exploration in the sub-Sahara region. The contracts have immediately produced
    moneys equaling US$40,000,000. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company is desirous
    of oil exploration in other parts of the world, however, because of certain regulations
    of the Nigerian Government, it is unable to move these funds to another region.\n\nPlease
    call me at your earliest convenience at 18-467-4975. Time is of the essence in
    this matter; very quickly the Nigerian Government will realize that the Central
    Bank is maintaining this amount on deposit, and attempt to levy certain depository
    taxes on it.\n\nYours truly,

    Prince Alyusi Islassis'
